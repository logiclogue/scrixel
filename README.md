# Scrixel

A game engine written for the web browser.

This project was started and a number of its components have been built.
However, the finished game engine was never achieved. I may come back in the
future to finish the project.

There was an old version of Scrixel, that I used to develop
[Sheepdog Dino](http://jordanlord.co.uk/projects/sheepdog-dino) and
[TomatAH](http://jordanlord.co.uk/projects/tomatah). Due to my poor level of
programming, at the time, the Scrixel engine is buried within their source code.

## Components
